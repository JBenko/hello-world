hello-world
===========

I am currently in school for Mobile Application Software Engineering and learning how to code.

-- I am looking for ideas on creating my first project, as well as possibly having someone guide me through the process of coding for the first time. --

I work as an IT Helpdesk Support Technician, I would like to learn as much as I can with any type of language. I enjoy golf and hockey, and hoping to be able to code like no other.
